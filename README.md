Assignment: Create a User List Page


Objective:
Design and develop a User List Page that displays user details retrieved from a given API.
The focus will be on design, responsiveness, and handling user interactions such as
adding, editing, and deleting user records.
API Details:
● API URL: https://mocki.io/v1/a6a0fb6b-a84a-4934-b3f2-5c92cc77c44e
The API will provide a list of user details which need to be displayed in a clean and
user-friendly format.
Requirements:

1. Fetch and Display User Data:
   ○ Fetch the user details from the provided API.
   ○ Display the data in any structured format (table, card, list, etc.).
   ○ Implement the functionality using React or Vue with TypeScript.
2. Add, Edit, Delete Functionality (No API Integration Needed):
   ○ Provide UI options for adding new users, editing existing users, and
   deleting users.
   ○ No actual API integration is required for these actions, but if you can handle
   the state change (for example, showing a new user in the list after adding
   them), bonus points will be awarded.

3. Design and Responsiveness:
   ○ The page design will be evaluated on aesthetic quality and user
   experience.
   ○ Ensure the design is fully responsive, working seamlessly across both
   mobile and desktop views.

4. Deployment:
   ○ Deploy the solution so it can be accessed via a live link.

Bonus Points:
● Managing state changes (for adding, editing, and deleting users) without actual API
integration.
● A well-designed and responsive layout that works smoothly across various devices.
Deliverables:

1. Live Link: A deployed version of the project.
2. GitHub URL: A GitHub repository link with complete commit history.
